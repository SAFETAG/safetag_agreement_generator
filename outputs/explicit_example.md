# Security Assessment Agreement

## Goal

The traditional corporate security assessment is based upon an assumption that an organization has the time, money, and manpower to aim for as close to perfect security as possible, and more importantly, that they will be able to have ongoing assessments over time. The Recipient of this assessment has none of these luxuries.

Therefore they have asked the Service Provider to design and use a customized combination of selected assessment techniques derived from standards in the security auditing world to provide a tailored risk assessment and mitigation consultation.

This audit will not only provide an assessment of the Recipients risks, but will also act as a teaching opportunity for the Service Provider to provide the Recipient a map of their digital footprint, an understanding of how their technology is tied to the threats they perceive, and guidance on how to seek out support in the future.

Lastly, the Service Provider is well connected to trusted digital security trainers around the world as well as large networks of resources and broader capabilities, including rapid response networks. They will use these preexisting relationships to help the Recipient identify the support they need to address their vulnerabilities.

## Parties


This contract agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as of July 12th, 2016 by and between ABC Assessing (the "Service Provider"), a Washington, DC Corporation located at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500 and XYC Company (the "Recipient"), a Colorado 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation located at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500,  (collectively the "Parties").


## Purpose of Agreement

The Recipient requests the Service Provider perform a security assessment (the "Engagement") by performing work outlined in the attached document titled ”Rules of Engagement”. The Parties therefore agree as follows:

## Scope of Work

The Service Provider will provide a security assessment as outlined in the attached document titled ”Rules of Engagement” (”Rules of Engagement”, "Statement of Work", or "SOW")

## Project Term


This Agreement takes effect immediately as of the Agreement Date, and remains in full force and effect until Service Provider has completed the Engagement (the "Term") which is estimated to be December 1st, 2016, unless earlier terminated by one party under the terms of this Agreement.

Service Provider will evaluate each such proposal at its standard rates and charges. Service Provider shall submit to Recipient a written response to each such proposal within 15 working days following receipt thereof. Service Providers written response shall include a statement of the availability of Service Providers personnel and resources, as well as any impact the proposed changes will have on the contract price or delivery dates of the SOW, or the warranty provisions of this Agreement.

* repeating the procedure set forth above, or
* terminating this Agreement pursuant to the section of this Agreement entitled "Termination of Agreement or Statements of Work."

## Additional Work and Addressing Vulnerabilities


The parties shall collaborate in good faith on all future work, if any, beyond the Initial Statement of Work, including for Assessment related incident response, security guidance, and vulnerability mitigation.

## Disputes


The parties agree that any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be submitted to JAMS, or its successor, for mediation, and if the matter is not resolved through mediation, then it shall be submitted to JAMS, or its successor, for final and binding arbitration pursuant to the clause set forth in Paragraph 5 below.

1. Either party may commence mediation by providing to JAMS and the other party a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of the dispute and the relief requested.
2. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a mediator from the JAMS panel of neutrals and in scheduling the mediation proceedings. The parties agree that they will participate in the mediation in good faith and that they will share equally in its costs.

4. Either party may initiate arbitration with respect to the matters submitted to mediation by filing a written demand for arbitration at any time following the initial mediation session or at any time following 45 days from the date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever occurs first (“Earliest Initiation Date”).

5. At no time prior to the Earliest Initiation Date shall either side initiate an arbitration or litigation related to this Agreement except to pursue a provisional remedy that is authorized by law or by JAMS Rules or by agreement of the parties. However, this limitation is inapplicable to a party if the other party refuses to comply with the requirements of Paragraph 3 above.

## Survival


The provisions of the Sections "Disputes", "Attorney Fees", "Ownership of Work Product", and "Limited Liability" within this Agreement and the Sections "Confidential Information" and "Information Security Safeguards" within the Rules of Engagement will survive any termination of this Agreement.


## Limited Liability


Recipient understands that digital security is a continually growing and changing field and that security guidance provided by Service Provider does not mean that Recipient will be able to secure their software and systems from every form of attack. There is no such thing as 100% security, and for example it is never possible to identify vulnerabilities in software or systems for threats that are not known at the time of the assessment.

Recipient assumes sole and total responsibility and risk for any damages or liabilities arising directly or indirectly out of the services, this agreement, Service Provider’s performance of this agreement, any obligations resulting therefrom, and Recipients’s reliance thereon; and Recipient agrees that any such damages or liabilities are not the responsibility of Service Provider.

Without limiting the foregoing, Service Provider and its officers, directors, employees and agents will in no event be liable for any special, incidental, consequential, or any other indirect loss or damage of any nature, including without limitation lost profits or lost revenues, caused to the business or property of Recipient or anyone else arising out of or related to the services, this agreement, Service Providers’s performance of this agreement, any obligations resulting therefrom, and Recipients’s reliance thereon.

The entire, aggregate, and maximum liability, if any, of Service Provider, its officers, directors, employees and agents for any and all claims, losses, damages, or expenses arising out of or related to the services, this agreement, Service Provider’s performance of this agreement, any obligation resulting therefrom, and Recipients’s reliance thereon, shall in no event be greater than the amount paid by Recipient to Service Provider under this agreement.

This limitation of liability is an essential and bargained for part of this agreement, and Service Provider would not perform the services without this limitation. No representative of Service Provider has authority to verbally modify the terms of this limitation.
