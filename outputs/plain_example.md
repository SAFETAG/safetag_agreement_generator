# Security Assessment

## Goal

The traditional corporate security assessment is based upon an assumption that an organization has the time, money, and manpower to aim for as close to perfect security as possible, and more importantly, that they will be able to have ongoing assessments over time. The recipient of this assessment has none of these luxuries.

Therefore they have asked the assessor to design and use a customized combination of selected assessment techniques derived from standards in the security auditing world to provide a tailored risk assessment and mitigation consultation.

This audit will not only provide an assessment of the recipients risks, but will also act as a teaching opportunity for the assessor to provide the recipient a map of their digital footprint, an understanding of how their technology is tied to the threats they perceive, and guidance on how to seek out support in the future.

Lastly, the assessor is well connected to trusted digital security trainers around the world as well as large networks of resources and broader capabilities, including rapid response networks. They will use these preexisting relationships to help the recipient identify the support they need to address their vulnerabilities.

## Parties



This contract agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as of July 12th, 2016 by and between ABC Assessing (the "Assessor") and XYC Company (the "Recipient") of the security assessment, (collectively the "Parties").

The Recipient requests the Assessor perform a security assessment, (the "Engagement") and may request the Assessor perform other services in the future; and

The Parties therefore agree as follows:



## Term and Termination



This Agreement takes effect immediately as of the Agreement Date, and remains in full force and effect until the Assessor has completed the Engagement (the "Term"), unless earlier terminated under the following conditions.

## Scope of Work

The Assessor will provide a security assessment as outlined in the attached document titled ”Rules of Engagement”

## Deliverables



## What deliverables will be produced during the Engagement?

The Assessor will provide the following deliverables to the Recipient.


* A report that shows the Recipient's current state of security, the process by which the Assessor came to these conclusions, and recommendations that will guide the Recipient's progression to meet their security goals.



## Who will the report be written for?

The Assessor will tailor the report for its targeted audiences in the following ways:


* The report will contain an easy-to-read executive summary with no technical jargon.
* The report will contain sufficient detail that later technical and/or security teams will be able to implement the recommendations.
* Each recommendation will include a summary statement that shows proof of need and contains no sensitive information. These statements will be written in a way that will allow the Recipiant to directly copy them into funding proposals.




## What do I do if the deliverables are not complete or if I want changes made?

The Recipient can request up to 1 revisions to a deliverable.





## Indemnification and Liability



## Is the Assessor responsible if we suffer an attack in the future?

The Recipient understands that digital security is a continually growing and changing field and that security guidance provided by the Assessor does not mean that the Recipient will be able to secure their software from every form of attack.

There is no such thing as 100% security, and for example it is never possible to identify vulnerabilities in software or systems for threats that are not known at the time of the assessment.

The Assessor shall be under no liability whatever to the Recipient for any indirect loss and/or expense (including loss of profit) suffered by the Recipient arising out of their security.
