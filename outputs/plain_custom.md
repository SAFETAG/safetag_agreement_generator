# Security Assessment Agreement

## Goal

The traditional corporate security assessment is based upon an assumption that an organization has the time, money, and manpower to aim for as close to perfect security as possible, and more importantly, that they will be able to have ongoing assessments over time. The Recipient of this assessment has none of these luxuries.

Therefore they have asked the Service Provider to design and use a customized combination of selected assessment techniques derived from standards in the security auditing world to provide a tailored risk assessment and mitigation consultation.

This audit will not only provide an assessment of the Recipients risks, but will also act as a teaching opportunity for the Service Provider to provide the Recipient a map of their digital footprint, an understanding of how their technology is tied to the threats they perceive, and guidance on how to seek out support in the future.

Lastly, the Service Provider is well connected to trusted digital security trainers around the world as well as large networks of resources and broader capabilities, including rapid response networks. They will use these preexisting relationships to help the Recipient identify the support they need to address their vulnerabilities.


## Parties



This contract agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as of July 12th 2016 by and between ABC Assessing (the "Service Provider") and XYC Company (the "Recipient"), (collectively the "Parties").



## Purpose of Agreement

## Scope of Work

The Service Provider will provide a security assessment as outlined in the attached document titled ”Rules of Engagement”

## Changes in the Scope

## Limitations on Liability

Recipient understands that digital security is a continually growing and changing field and that security guidance provided by Service Provider does not mean that Recipient will be able to secure their software and systems from every form of attack.

**Recipient assumes sole and total responsibility and risk for any damages or liabilities arising directly or indirectly out of the services, this agreement, Service Provider’s performance of this agreement, any obligations resulting therefrom, and Recipients’s reliance thereon; and Recipient agrees that any such damages or liabilities are not the responsibility of Service Provider.**

**The entire, aggregate, and maximum liability, if any, of Service Provider, its officers, directors, employees and agents for any and all claims, losses, damages, or expenses arising out of or related to the services, this agreement, Service Provider’s performance of this agreement, any obligation resulting therefrom, and Recipients’s reliance thereon, shall in no event be greater than the amount paid by Recipient to Service Provider under this agreement.**

**This limitation of liability is an essential and bargained for part of this agreement, and Service Provider would not perform the services without this limitation. No representative of Service Provider has authority to verbally modify the terms of this limitation.**




## Indemnification

Each party will indemnify the other party from any third-party claims resulting in losses, damages, liabilities, costs, charges, and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, arising out of any breach of the indemnifying party’s representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, or, in the case of Client’s indemnification of Contractor, arising out of the use of Services provided under this Agreement.
