The Assessor will tailor the report for its targeted audiences in the following ways:


* {{A way the report is tailored.}}
* {{i.e. The report will contain an easy-to-read executive summary with no technical jargon.}}

## Indemnification and Liability



## Is the Assessor responsible if we suffer an attack in the future?

The Recipient understands that digital security is a continually growing and changing field and that security guidance provided by the Assessor does not mean that the Recipient will be able to secure their software from every form of attack.

There is no such thing as 100% security, and for example it is never possible to identify vulnerabilities in software or systems for threats that are not known at the time of the assessment.

The Assessor shall be under no liability whatever to the Recipient for any indirect loss and/or expense (including loss of profit) suffered by the Recipient arising out of their security.




## Payment
