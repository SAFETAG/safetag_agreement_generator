# Security Assessment Agreement

## Goal

The traditional corporate security assessment is based upon an assumption that an organization has the time, money, and manpower to aim for as close to perfect security as possible, and more importantly, that they will be able to have ongoing assessments over time. The Recipient of this assessment has none of these luxuries.

Therefore they have asked the Service Provider to design and use a customized combination of selected assessment techniques derived from standards in the security auditing world to provide a tailored risk assessment and mitigation consultation.

This audit will not only provide an assessment of the Recipients risks, but will also act as a teaching opportunity for the Service Provider to provide the Recipient a map of their digital footprint, an understanding of how their technology is tied to the threats they perceive, and guidance on how to seek out support in the future.

Lastly, the Service Provider is well connected to trusted digital security trainers around the world as well as large networks of resources and broader capabilities, including rapid response networks. They will use these preexisting relationships to help the Recipient identify the support they need to address their vulnerabilities.

## Parties


This contract agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as of July 12th 2016 by and between ABC Assessing (the "Service Provider"), a Washington, DC Corporation located at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500 and XYC Company (the "Recipient"), a Colorado 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation located at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500,  (collectively the "Parties").


## Purpose of Agreement

The Recipient requests the Service Provider perform a security assessment (the "Engagement") by performing work outlined in the attached document titled ”Rules of Engagement”. The Parties therefore agree as follows:

## Scope of Work

The Service Provider will provide a security assessment as outlined in the attached document titled ”Rules of Engagement” (”Rules of Engagement”, "Statement of Work", or "SOW")

## Project Term


This Agreement takes effect immediately as of the Agreement Date, and remains in full force and effect until Service Provider has completed the Engagement (the "Term"), which is estimated to be January 14th 2017 , unless earlier terminated by one party under the terms of this Agreement. All Statements of Work will automatically terminate upon early termination of this Agreement.


## Changes in Project Scope


If at any time following execution of a Statement of Work by Service Provider, Recipient should desire a change in Service Providers performance under the Statement of Work that will alter or amend the Specifications or other elements of the Statement of Work, Recipient shall submit to Service Provider a written proposal specifying the desired changes.



Service Provider will evaluate each such proposal at its standard rates and charges. Service Provider shall submit to Recipient a written response to each such proposal within 15 working days following receipt thereof. Service Providers written response shall include a statement of the availability of Service Providers personnel and resources, as well as any impact the proposed changes will have on the contract price or delivery dates of the SOW, or the warranty provisions of this Agreement. The signature of Recipient's authorized representative on such a document will be deemed to be approval of the modification and any associated fees.




### Subcontracting

Service Provider shall not subcontract its obligations under this Agreement to another person or entity, in whole or in part, without Recipients prior written approval. Prior to seeking Recipients consent, Service Provider will provide Recipient with full details of the proposed Contractor’s involvement including the identity of the Contractor, a description of the access to Confidential Information proposed, and any other information Recipient may reasonably request in order to assess the risks involved in allowing the Contractor to carry out Activities in this Engagement.
